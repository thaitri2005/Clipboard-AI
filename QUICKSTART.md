# üéâ Ready to Go! Final Steps

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done:
- ‚úÖ Python dependencies installed (pyperclip, pynput)
- ‚úÖ Ollama CLI installed via winget
- ‚úÖ Project configured for SQL tasks with phi3:mini model

## üîÑ What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Restart PowerShell
Ollama was just installed, so you need to **close and reopen PowerShell** for it to be available in your PATH.

### Step 2: Pull the AI Model
After restarting PowerShell, run:
```powershell
ollama pull phi3:mini
```
This will download the lightweight SQL-capable model (~2.3GB). It might take a few minutes.

### Step 3: Test Ollama (Optional but Recommended)
```powershell
ollama run phi3:mini
```
Type something like: `Explain SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;`
Press Enter to see the response.
Type `/bye` to exit.

### Step 4: Run the Application
```powershell
.\start.bat
```
Or directly:
```powershell
python clipboard_ai.py
```

## üéØ How to Use:

1. **Keep the terminal window open** (the app needs to run)
2. **Copy** any text/SQL to clipboard (Ctrl+C)
3. **Press** `Ctrl+Shift+G`
4. **Wait** for AI processing (you'll see progress in terminal)
5. **Paste** the AI response (Ctrl+V)

## üí° Quick Test:

Try this:
1. Copy this text: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18`
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+G`
3. Wait for the AI to explain it
4. Paste the result!

## üîß Customization (config.py):

```python
MODEL = "phi3:mini"  # Change to other models if needed
SYSTEM_PROMPT = ""   # Add instructions like "Optimize this SQL:"
TIMEOUT = 120        # Adjust if needed
VERBOSE = True       # Show detailed output
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting:

**If Ollama still not found after restart:**
- Check if it's running: Look for Ollama in system tray
- Try manual install: https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe
- Add to PATH manually if needed

**If model pull fails:**
- Check internet connection
- Try: `ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` (smaller, 1GB)
- Or: `ollama pull codellama:7b` (larger, better)

## üöÄ That's It!

You now have a local AI clipboard assistant optimized for SQL tasks!

**Next**: Close this PowerShell, open a new one, and run:
```powershell
cd D:\Local-AI-Clipboard
ollama pull phi3:mini
.\start.bat
```
